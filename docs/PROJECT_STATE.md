Metadata SSOT                = Supabase PostgreSQL

### 3.2 Backup / recovery separation (living)

```text
DATABASE RECOVERY:
  Historical local PostgreSQL dump EXISTS
  Path: C:\BitRymDym-recovery\bitrymdym-production-pre-account-profile-01.dump
  Excludes: Storage object bytes
  Restore: NOT VERIFIED

  Local Windows Layer-2 = 43/43 RESTORE VERIFIED
    backup id  = local-layer2-full-20261005T040146Z-42d6212b

  AWS Object Lock = DEFERRED
  ARCH-05 = CLOSED / VERIFIED · live Storage 11 (USER 8 · PLATFORM 3 · ORPHAN 0)
  Local/VPS retained evidence = 43/43 (incl. 32 deleted orphans)
  Backup ≠ Storage SSOT ≠ VPS

## 5. Next Session Entry

```text
NEXT SESSION ENTRY = Read FINAL_COLD_START_HANDOFF.md
                 → MASTER_HANDOFF.md / this PROJECT_STATE
                 → Confirm tip 1c63080 = production
                 → POLISH-01 CLOSED · P0/P1/P2 CLOSED
                 → NEXT GATE = P3 READ-ONLY AUDIT (prompt in FINAL_COLD_START)
                 → Do NOT implement P3 without Owner GO after Design Freeze
                 → Do NOT reopen ARCH-05 / BPM / replace / sample policy without new evidence
                 → Do NOT fix EXPORT_WAV in product scope without separate Owner GO
                 → Do NOT clean dirty WIP without Owner GO

## 6. Decision vs Delivery (selected recent)

| ID / Track | Decision | Delivery |
|------------|----------|----------|
| OD-PL-01…06 | **CLOSED / ACCEPTED** | POLISH-01 **CLOSED / PRODUCTION VERIFIED** @ `579acb3` + residual `1c63080` |
| P0 PLATFORM deny | Owner GO | **CLOSED / PRODUCTION VERIFIED** @ `fdfff71` |
| P1 Sample Policy | Owner GO | **CLOSED / PRODUCTION VERIFIED** @ `5927e35` |
| P2 Explicit Replace | OD-P2-01…07 CLOSED | **CLOSED / PRODUCTION VERIFIED** @ `943d81e` |
| ARCH-05 | Owner GO delete | **CLOSED / VERIFIED** |
| OD-08 Premium tiers | CLOSED | W2-A/B in tree |
| P3 | **OPEN** · audit required | **NOT STARTED** |

---

## 7. Out of scope / deferred (living)

STEMS · payments / Premium catalog · recording Premium overlay · Gold 90d PRODUCTION · audio-artifacts janitor · `/ranks` / `/premium` UI · billing · W2-B Mix/Render live · W4 remaining Admin P2 (last-admin TOCTOU · no durable idempotency · live last-admin concurrency · published USER beat retain · migration timestamp drift) · **P3 implementation** until Design Freeze + Owner GO.

---

## 8. Local worktree note

Typical residue (**nie czyścić / nie stage'ować bez GO**): `.agents/` · `.cursor/` · `skills-lock.json` · `infra/oracle/` · `.env*` · secrets · backup artifacts · cleanup scripts · untracked audits WIP.

**Nigdy:** `git add .` / `-A` / `-u` — tylko exact allowlist.
